### Step 1: Access Organization Settings
1. Go to https://github.com/longevitycoach
2. Click on **"Settings"** tab (you need to be an organization owner)
3. Select **"Profile"** from the left sidebar

### Step 2: Upload Logo
1. In the **"Profile picture"** section, click **"Upload new picture"**
2. Select the logo file: `/Users/ma3u/projects/longevitycoach-github/.github/profile/logo.png`
3. Crop/adjust as needed (recommended: square aspect ratio)
4. Click **"Set new profile picture"**

### Step 3: Verify
1. Return to https://github.com/longevitycoach
2. The logo should now appear in:
   - Organization header
   - Repository listings
   - Profile page
   - README (already working)

## \ud83d\udc40 What's Already Working

- ✅ Logo in profile README: https://github.com/longevitycoach/.github/tree/main/profile
- ✅ Organization description and website link
- ✅ Professional badge layout
- ✅ Complete organization profile content

## \ud83d\udccc Logo Location

The logo file is available at:
- **Local**: `/Users/ma3u/projects/longevitycoach-github/.github/profile/logo.png`
- **GitHub**: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/longevitycoach/.github/main/profile/logo.png

## \ud83d\udcb0 Alternative: GitHub CLI (if available)

Unfortunately, GitHub CLI doesn't support organization avatar uploads directly. The manual web interface method above is the standard approach.

**Note**: The organization avatar update may take a few minutes to propagate across GitHub's interface.
